Install
-------

    $ curl -sSL https://raw.github.com/edavis/brew-pip/master/brew_pip.py > ~/bin/brew-pip
    $ chmod +x ~/bin/brew-pip

Usage
-----

    brew pip mercurial        # install the latest mercurial package
    brew pip django==1.2      # install django-1.2
    brew pip ~/tox-1.3.tar.gz # can install local packages, too
    brew pip -u django==1.3.1 # upgrade to django-1.3.1
    brew pip -k ipython       # install ipython, but don't link it (i.e., keg-only)
    brew rm django            # uninstallation taken care of by homebrew itself
    brew pip -h               # for help

Setup
-----

So python can load your installed libraries, you need to update your `PYTHONPATH`:

    export PYTHONPATH=$(brew --prefix)/lib/python2.7/site-packages

And for any scripts to be found, you need to update your `PATH`:

    export PATH=$PATH:$(brew --prefix)/share/python

Remember to add this environment variable in your shell profile, usually like:

    export HOMEBREW_CELLAR=$(brew --prefix)/Cellar


But doesn't everybody use virtualenv now?
-----------------------------------------

Why, yes, they do.  But that doesn't mean global installations are
totally useless.  What if you want to use a package *without* being
active in a virtualenv -- like say ipython?

With `brew pip` you can globally install a select few packages while
relying on virtualenv for everything else.

It's the best of both worlds.
